LandmarkTech:
  servers: 90% are Linux (running a linus os/dist)
           10% are Windows   
  work stations: 
    Windows --> 50 Windows 
    MacOS   ---> 40 Mac Laptop
    others  ---> 10

  mobaXterm --1
  git bash  --2
  putty
  PowerShell & Command prompt 

MacOS Laptop:

Operating
  Linux   - Linus
  Windows - Bill Gates

How to access a Linus server running in AWS:
  username: ec2-user / Etech-admin
  
  authentication:
    password authentication: admin@124
    multi-factor authentication (password + code):

    ssh key 

  ssh-client -- putty / Git bash / mobaXterm 

  Server's address: ip-address, dns 

      ssh jane@demoServer or  ssh jane@10.1.10.2
      ssh jane@appServer  0r  ssh jane@10.10.10.8
      ssh jane@dbServer   0r  ssh -i key27.pem jane@10.10.10.8

      ssh userName@ip-address

  Firewall is open on required ports: 

   SSH = Secure SHELL 

   ssh userName@ip-address
